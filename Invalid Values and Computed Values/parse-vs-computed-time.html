          This example illustrates that the browser does not check the syntax of
          a custom property at parse time, it checks it at computed value time.
          In this case 2px is not a valid color and so the background-color is
          set to `unset` and since background-color is not inherited this is
          equivalent to `initial` which is <em>transparent</em>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="target-2">
        <p>
          This is another example of the behavior alluded to above. Again, in
          this case, 2px is not a valid color but since this custom property has
          been <em>registered</em> with an initial-value of
          <span>sky blue</span> then the browser uses that as a fallback.
